Agency
=========================

This is a flask implementation of [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/), a one page HTML theme for freelancers created by Start Bootstrap.

I wanted to use it for my freelancers group and made a few mods. We ended up using discarding this repo and using a different approach. Putting it out here for someone to use. It takes advantage of the Jinja templates as much possible.

How to run locally
---------------------------------------

* Clone this repo to a local folder
* Create a python 3 environment and activate it `pyvenv agency`
* Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the local server with `python agency.py`
